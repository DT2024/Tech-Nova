                    <p>Team Lead + Backend Developer</p>
                    <p>
                        Skills: Java, J2EE, Node.js, REST API, Microservices, MongoDB, MySQL, DynamoDB, 
                        Angular, Next.js, Neo4j, R, Python (ML/DL), CNN, Bash, HTML/CSS
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the team lead, I coordinated development tasks and ensured project milestones were met. 
                        I focused on backend systems, including multi-database integration, API development, 
                        and multi-service deployment using Java and Node.js. I also implemented advanced features like 
                        media processing, visual learning systems, and machine learning models (e.g., 98% accurate traffic sign recognition). 
                        Additionally, I worked with Neo4j and R for data analysis and relationship graph visualization.

                    <p>
                        Designed and deployed a deep learning system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 
                        to classify traffic signs with 98% accuracy. Implemented the full pipeline from data preprocessing 
                        to model training and evaluation, demonstrating strong AI logic and programming architecture.

                    <h3>Fullstack App with Next.js & Java</h3>
                    <p>
                        Led a full-cycle backend solution using Java microservices and Next.js. 
                        Built complex REST APIs, integrated MongoDB, DynamoDB, and MySQL, and handled multi-service deployment. 
                        Oversaw every stage from system planning to frontend/backend logic implementation and production deployment.
